Oceanink recently ran a week-long Splatfest event for charity, with the help of Martin from Atlassian. The event raised $2300 for Sydney Childrens Hospital's Fund (SCHF), which was later doubled by Atlassian. To do this, we ran a couple of Splatfest sessions for the divise debate Martin had come up with - Meat Pie vs Sausage Roll.

It was a lot of fun to run, and also quite novel as I hadn't run a Splatfest before. So, I figured why not write down some of the discussions we had when organising it, and the decisions we made, in case they help anyone looking to run their own Splatfest in the future.
