I decided I needed a blog, and that doesn't drive me crazy to write for (like Medium did). So, here we are, my own blog! Not quite sure yet where this will go, but I guess we'll see. :D I'm currently working on some thoughts from the recent Splatfest event I helped run for Oceanink, and then I'll probably work on some articles about why I'm moving from Twitch to Youtube.
